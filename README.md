## About Me
I'm Abel Santillan Rodríguez, a passionate student of Physics Engineering currently in the 9th semester at the Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro.

## 🚀 My Journey
I am on an exciting journey exploring the intersection of physics and technology, with a particular focus on data science and machine learning.

My focus is on apply computational methods to solve problems in physics and engineering, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in this field.

## 📚 Academic Background
- Studying at the Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro.
- Currently in the 9th semester of the Physics Engineering program.

## 📚🧮 Research and Projects
- [Research on Mechanical-Electrodynamical problem.](https://rmf.smf.mx/ojs/index.php/rmf-e/article/view/7233)
